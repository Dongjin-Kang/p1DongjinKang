## Microwave

A microwave is an electronic device used for reheating semi-cooked foods or for simple cooking.  Compared to other home appliances, the function is simple and the difference between products is not big, but it is better to consider several things together, such as size and usage, to increase utilization.

The microwave oven has several function buttons, which consist of fast thawing, deodorizing, heating, automatic cooking, life/snack, clock, cancellation, cooking start, time adjustment, locking, and door buttons.

A brief description of the functions of this microwave oven is as follows:

*Speed thawing is a function that reduces thawing time.\
*Deodorization forces air circulation through a blast to remove the smell inside.\
*Heating/auto-cooking/living/snacking, the microwave operates with the output and time set according to the ingredients and dishes.\
*Speed thawing is a function that reduces thawing time.\
*Locking is a function of locking the bertzon to prevent malfunction due to infant touch.\
*-/+ is a microwave operation time setting function.\
*Door buttons are functions that open microwave doors.

## The Issues with The Current Design 

Some of the problems with this microwave design include heating, automatic cooking, and living/snacking. These functions actually function according to the output and time set by each semi-cooked food and simple dish. These features make it easy to operate the microwave that fits your food with a single click. However, there is an inconvenience that the setting value has already been set and cannot be changed. If you don't eat food that's tailored to this function, it's actually a completely unnecessary function, and a number of already set buttons make the microwave interface look messy.

## The Issues with The Current Design 

1. Download a [release](https://github.com/ybakos/proclipsing/releases) **.zip** file.
2. Unzip the file and place the folder in a convenient location.
3. In Eclipse, select the menu item _Help > Install New Software_. In the dialogue that appears, select the _Add..._ button. Enter **Proclipsing** as the _Name:_, and select the _Local..._ button. Navigate to the location of your Proclipsing folder, and within, select the **proclipsingSite** folder and select the _Open_ button.
4. Back in the _Install_ dialogue, select the _Select All_ button, and then select _Next >_.
5. Accept the license agreement and select _Finish_. If you are prompted to restart Eclipse, do it.

## P5 Exporter

We've also teamed up with Daniel Howe, so you can get his P5 Exporter from the same update site. With P5 Exporter, you can export projects from eclipse similar to the way you do from the Processing IDE.
